Hi, I am Ben, an application developer that is interested in AI, automation and cooperative design. I specialise in game development but also work on general web applications. My BSc dissertation used Anger to explore the simulation of Emotion based decision making in AI, this lead to the understanding that more than one emotion is needed to be portrayed in order to create a baseline. My MSc dissertation used the Twitch platform in order to explore how Coopertation can be achieved in audience based media, this was achieved through asymetric design. See my projects on here to have a look at what I can do.
